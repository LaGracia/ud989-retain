## Description

This is a Udacity minicourse project for JavaScript Design Patterns. The main objective was to identify the components of the MVO structure.

### Features

The app features an input field into which the user can type notes. These are displayed as sticky notes and saved in the browser's local storage. The data is retained, or persists, even after the user quits the browser.

### Credits

Unlike most of my Udacity projects, this one was explained practically step by step by the course instructor, so I never had to consult the forum to figure out how the code worked. Links to information elsewhere are in my JS file as comments.

### License

I do not own the source code for this app. My work on it is licensed under [GitHubâ€™s terms of service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/), meaning you can view and fork this repository.
